# Fashion Product Image Classifier

## Overview
This project explores the use of **deep learning** for automated product categorization in e-commerce. The goal is to accurately classify product images into **Apparel** or **Footwear**, streamlining the tagging process, improving user experience, and enhancing recommendation systems.

Prepared by: Vy Nguyen, Becky Wang, Chia-Chien Chang, Xinying Wu, Yunling Li

Key results include:
- Final neural network (30-4 hidden layers) achieved **99.83% validation and test accuracy**
- Outperformed logistic regression by **0.53%**, which translates to significant cost and labor savings at scale
- Hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques contributed to strong generalization and low overfitting
- Business analysis estimated this improvement could reduce misclassification for over 10,000 products daily, minimizing manual corrections and customer service load

> **Strategic Insight:** Even a small gain in model accuracy can translate into major business value in high-volume platforms â€” enabling scalable product tagging, better recommendations, and improved customer trust.

|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression  | 99.7%          | 99.3%                | 99.3%         |
| Neural Net (7-4)     | 99.5%          | 99.83%               | 99.83%        |

- Best performing architecture was a DNN with (30, 4) hidden units
- No overfitting observed â€” validation loss tracked training loss closely
- Hyperparameter tuning (especially with regularization) stabilized learning and ensured generalization

## What I Learned
- Even simple DNNs can outperform logistic regression when tuned well, especially for structured binary tasks
- Weight initialization, regularization, and optimizer choice play a crucial role in training stability
- Small accuracy improvements can drive big downstream value in real-world, high-volume applications
- Experimental tracking across architectures is key to building confidence in model choice

## What I Plan to Improve
- Explore convolutional neural networks with more aggressive data augmentation to scale across more categories
- Test deployment pipelines for automated image tagging in real-time
- Evaluate ensemble or stacking methods to combine logistic and deep models
- Expand dataset with multi-class product categories to improve platform relevance
